        <h1>Updates</h1>
        
        <h3>July 28th, 2015</h3>
        <p>I've rebuilt my persona guide from the ground up using express and swig, which I've been learning on my own. I also started work on a pokedex site that I'm going to be building with Brigette. On treehouse, I finished Object Oriented Javascript and Jquery Plugins and on Codecademy I've started work on Ruby on Rails.</p>

        <h3>July 8th, 2015</h3>
        <p>Since my last update, I have completed all of the calendar pages, social link pages, and added visual transitions to my Persona site. Despite having some trouble, the node.js server that is running it should be stable now with the use of the program "forever." I have also finished the Ruby course on Codecademy and have made progress on the new Object Oriented Javascript course on Treehouse.</p>

        <h3>June 26th, 2015</h3>
        <p>As of now I have finished git basics and node.js and have been working on a new site/guide about Persona 4 golden using my newly acquired node.js skills. The site can be found <a href="http://persona.lawlietblack.com:3000">here</a> as a work in progress. I'm currently experimenting with texture overlays and transitional visual effects, as well as populating the content of the site while getting practice using git version control. I also added a subdomain, <a href="http://dev.lawlietblack.com">dev.lawlietblack.com</a> where I'm keeping the miscellaneous projects that I've worked on from Treehouse and Codecademy that aren't in my Portfolio</p>
          
        <h3>June 20th, 2015</h3>
        <p>I have been working on getting a solid unix-based development enviroment for my windows laptop, and ended up using Cigwyn and console2, which I'm pretty satisfied with. I also installed OpenSUSE as a second OS for my laptop, but I'm still pretty new to package control, so I haven't quite gotten to the point where I can transition to that OS completely.</p>

        <h3>June 13th, 2015</h3>
        <p>Since the last entry, I have finished AJAX from treehouse and have also completed the courses on website optimization, accessibility, console foundations and basic node.js. I have started the second node.js course, git basics, and angularjs on treehouse. On codecademy, I finally finished all of the projects on angularJS and have started to learn Ruby and Python. I have added a drawing app and a flickr search app to the projects page, adding to the simple to-do list and dice roller that were already there.</p>

        <h3>May 31st, 2015</h3>
        <p>I'm currently working on learning AnularJS from Codecademy and AJAX from treehouse. I finished a page for Civilization V that can be found in my portfolio and I made a drop-down menu for my projects page using angularJS. I also made a treehouse card using AJAX that gets my JSON file from treehouse servers and put it on my about page.</p>
        
        <h3>May 25th, 2015</h3>
        <p>Finished the responsive layouts course on Treehouse and continued work on the AngularJS class on Codecademy. I added some apps to my project page and made a list of my skills for my about page.</p>

        <h3>May 21st, 2015</h3>
        <p>On Treehouse, I've gotten through the HTML Tables, Interactive JavaScript, and HTML Video and Audio courses and learned more about DOM manipulation and also made my first set of video captions. I also started work on the Responsive Layouts course.</p>

        <h3>May 16th, 2015</h3>
        <p>Finished JQuery on Treehouse and made a spoiler revealer, a lightbox, drop-down mobile navigation, a responsive password form, and a simple drawing app which I put on my projects page. I also got through the first section of AngularJS, where I got my first taste of MVC frameworks, which I used to make myself a journal page.</p>

        <h3>May 11th, 2015</h3>
        <p>Finished both of the website courses on Codecademy, learning bootstrap and more jQuery techniques and finished the second JavaScript course on Treehouse, solidifying my foundations on loops, arrays, and functions.
